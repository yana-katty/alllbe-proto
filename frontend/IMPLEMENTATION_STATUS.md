## Phase 2: Backend Integration - 📋 TODO

### Planned Features
- [ ] Replace mock data with tRPC queries
  - [ ] `experience.list` - Discover page
  - [ ] `experience.getById` - Detail page
  - [ ] `booking.create` - Booking flow
  - [ ] `booking.listByUser` - My experiences page
  
- [ ] Error Handling
  - [ ] Error boundaries for graceful failures
  - [ ] Toast notifications for user feedback
  - [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed requests
  
- [ ] Loading States
  - [ ] Use LoadingSpinner component
  - [ ] Skeleton loaders for better UX
  - [ ] Optimistic updates

### Backend Endpoints Needed
```typescript
// Experience endpoints
trpc.experience.list.useQuery({ limit, offset, category })
trpc.experience.getById.useQuery(id)

// Booking endpoints
trpc.booking.create.useMutation()
trpc.booking.listByUser.useQuery(userId)
trpc.booking.getById.useQuery(bookingId)

// User endpoints (Phase 3)
trpc.user.me.useQuery()
```

## Phase 3: Auth0 Integration - 📋 TODO

### Planned Features
- [ ] Install and configure Auth0 SDK
- [ ] Setup Auth0Provider in `app/providers.tsx`
- [ ] Implement login/logout flows
- [ ] Protect authenticated routes
- [ ] Add JWT tokens to tRPC requests
- [ ] User profile management

### Auth0 Configuration
```typescript
// Phase 3 implementation
import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

// Environment variables needed:
// NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN
// NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
// NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE
// NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI
```

## Developer Notes

### Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create page component in `app/[route]/page.tsx`
2. Use shared Header and Footer components
3. Import from `lib/constants.ts` for mock data
4. Follow existing patterns for consistency

### Adding New Components

1. Create component in appropriate directory:
   - `components/shared/` - Shared components
   - `components/features/` - Feature-specific components
   - `components/ui/` - shadcn/ui primitives

2. Export from index file for easy imports
3. Use TypeScript for prop types
4. Follow naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Component-first architecture
- Props interfaces defined at top of component files
- Consistent use of `'use client'` directive for client components

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

- ⚠️ Mock data only - no real backend integration
- ⚠️ No authentication - LOGIN button is placeholder
- ⚠️ No actual booking creation - form data not persisted
- ⚠️ No payment integration - shows "現地決済のみ"
- ⚠️ Category filters on discover page are not functional
- ⚠️ Search functionality not implemented
- ⚠️ No error boundaries yet
- ⚠️ Loading states show briefly but not fully implemented

These are expected for Phase 1 MVP and will be addressed in subsequent phases.
